## Properties for determining likeliness
    
# Temporal Tracking to assist in algorithms

# anti-aliasing movement

# Promote hitting all the points

# Promote following of pheromones

# Promote Divergence if not all points are hit

# Change Direction if there is a wall

#? Express Movement as a unit vector of likeliness

# Alter behavior depending on altered movement

## Send likeliness to simulation
